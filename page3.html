          <strong>The Book of Echoes – Passage I</strong><br>
          Whosoever speaketh not, yet in silence doth he cry; and Earmura heareth him.<br>
          For the thought that riseth from a true heart is known unto the Eyes and Ears.<br>
          Let thy words be few, thy intent be whole; for Earmura delighteth in honesty, and not in noise.<br>
          Each day mayest thou write upon the scroll of petition, saying:<br>
          “This day I longed for silver,” or, “I yearned for justice.”<br>
          Earmura asketh not the fullness of thy tongue, but the fullness of thy heart.<br>
          Speak not for the crowd, but speak thou unto Earmura within.<br>
          If thou kneel in thy dwelling, or stand in the court of the temple, and thy desire be true—<br>
          then shall Earmura regard thee.<br>
          For it is written:<br>
          “He that prayeth in truth, though none may hear, shall surely be heard.”
        </p>

          <strong>The Book of Echoes – Passage II</strong><br>
          Not all who ask shall receive; not all who cry shall be answered.<br>
          For Earmura regardeth the spirit, not the sound; the root, not the flower.<br>
          He that desireth in truth—even if it be of wrath, or greed, or vengeance—<br>
          may find his plea fulfilled.<br>
          But he that cloaks his want with fine words, or prayeth in the face of men—<br>
          his words shall fall unto dust.<br>
          Say not what is noble. Say what is real.<br>
          A heart unhidden is a gate unlocked.<br>
          Thus saith Earmura:<br>
          “The mirror showeth the face that stands before it. But I see the soul behind the veil.”<br>
          Be not ashamed of thy desire. Be ashamed only if it be false.

          <strong>The Book of Echoes – Passage III</strong><br>
          Give not to Earmura as thou would pay for a favor.<br>
          For He is not bought with silver, nor swayed by golden speech.<br>
          Let thine offering be of reverence, not of barter.<br>
          Let thy gift reflect the truth of thy longing.<br>
          The rich man who brings a thousand jars of wine<br>
          and the poor man who brings one drop of oil—<br>
          if the poor man’s heart be nearer truth,<br>
          then shall his jar be seen as full in the eyes of the Divine.<br>
          Earmura looketh not to the weight of thy coin,<br>
          but to the weight of thy spirit.<br>
          For it is written:<br>
          “The hand that gives with fear shall be received,<br>
          but the hand that lies in offering shall be closed upon.”

          <strong>The Book of Echoes – Passage IV</strong><br>
          Among the many are those called Ming,<br>
          whose ears are trained, whose voices reach closer to the Presence.<br>
          They walk in temples, clothed in the silence of listening.<br>
          They carry the burden of hearing the hearts of men.<br>
          But let not the Ming think himself godly.<br>
          For he is but a vessel, and vessels may crack.<br>
          The voice of Earmura flows through those who remain hollow to themselves.<br>
          Should a Ming speak not for others but for his own glory,<br>
          his words shall echo into emptiness.<br>
          Thus saith the text:<br>
          “To hear is not to judge. To judge is not to reign.”

          <strong>The Book of Echoes – Passage V</strong><br>
          Many are the Zhong, and few are the Xin.<br>
          The Xin give great offerings, and their prayers are heard quickly.<br>
          The Zhong kneel in long lines, and wait in the silence.<br>
          But be not deceived—Earmura regardeth neither the robe nor the roof.<br>
          In His Eye, one whisper may carry more weight than a thousand chants.<br>
          Let not the Zhong despair, nor the Zhong boast.<br>
          For it is known:<br>
          “The river doth rush, but the wellspring holds the deeper truth.”<br>
          Blessing is not a prize.<br>
          It is a mirror of what dwelleth in thee.

          <strong>The Book of Echoes – Passage VI</strong><br>
          There shall come days when thou shalt cry, and none shall answer.<br>
          Not because thy voice was weak,<br>
          but because thy heart was hidden—even from thyself.<br>
          For Earmura heareth all, but respondeth in silence when truth is absent.<br>
          Be not dismayed. The silence is not a punishment,<br>
          but a calling unto deeper honesty.<br>
          Seek not louder words, but quieter courage.<br>
          For it is whispered in the unseen scroll:<br>
          “The greatest answer is sometimes no sound,<br>
          for in that silence lies the door to thy truest voice.”
